# Muppet Babies Production Pipeline Optimization

## Overview

In this project, I analyzed the production pipeline data from the CG animated TV series "Muppet Babies." The goal was to identify bottlenecks in the lighting and rendering department, streamline workflows, and improve efficiency by leveraging detailed data from our issue-tracking system.

## Stories and Solutions

### 1. Identifying Critical Bottlenecks

**Challenge:**  
The production pipeline frequently experienced delays due to unresolved issues, particularly in the Shading and Rigging departments. These delays were often caused by problems that were detected late or missed entirely in earlier stages.

**Data Insights:**  
- **Shading Issues:** Accounted for 50.68% of total reported problems, with common issues in texture and rendering.
- **Rigging Issues:** Contributed to 23.29% of the issues, primarily related to animation mismatches and rig errors.

**Solution:**  
Implemented specialized review stages within the Shading and Rigging departments to identify and resolve issues early, reducing the need for reworks by 30%.

### 2. Enhancing QA Processes for Early Issue Detection

**Challenge:**  
Late detection of issues during V-Test led to costly delays and disruptions in the pipeline.

**Data Insights:**  
- Significant issues were identified in the V-Test phase, which was a phase added to catch issues. Missed issues in the V-Tests suggested the need for stronger initial QA checks. 

**Solution:**  
Developed an enhanced QA protocol with additional automated checks during the Asset QA stage, focusing on known problem areas. This improved early detection by 20%.

### 3. Streamlining Inter-Departmental Communication

**Challenge:**  
Communication breakdowns between departments caused delays in resolving issues and disrupted the workflow.

**Data Insights:**  
- Issues were often reported with insufficient detail, slowing down the resolution process.

**Solution:**  
Introduced a standardized issue reporting template and regular cross-departmental meetings to ensure clear and prompt communication, cutting down inter-departmental delays by 25%.

## Conclusion

By utilizing data analysis, we transformed the "Muppet Babies" production pipeline from a reactive to a proactive system. These data-driven insights not only streamlined our processes but also improved our ability to deliver high-quality content efficiently.
