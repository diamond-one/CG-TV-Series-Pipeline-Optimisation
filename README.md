# CG TV Series Pipeline Optimisation

## Overview

In this project, I analyzed the production pipeline data from the CG animated TV series "Muppet Babies." The goal was to identify bottlenecks in the lighting and rendering department, streamline workflows, and improve efficiency by leveraging detailed data from our issue-tracking system.

## Stories and Solutions

### 1. Identifying Critical Bottlenecks

**Challenge:**  
The production pipeline frequently experienced delays due to unresolved issues, particularly in the Shading and Rigging departments. These delays were often caused by problems that were detected late or missed entirely in earlier stages.

**Data Insights:**  
- **Shading Issues:** Accounted for 50.68% of total reported problems, with common issues in texture and rendering.
- **Rigging Issues:** Contributed to 23.29% of the issues, primarily related to animation mismatches and rig errors.

**Solution:**  
Implemented specialized review stages within the Shading and Rigging departments to identify and resolve issues early, reducing the need for reworks by 30%.

### 2. Enhancing QA Processes for Early Issue Detection

**Challenge:**  
Late detection of issues during V-Test led to costly delays and disruptions in the pipeline.

**Data Insights:**  
- Significant issues were identified in the V-Test phase, which was a phase added to catch issues. Missed issues in the V-Tests suggested the need for stronger initial QA checks. 

**Solution:**  
Developed an enhanced QA protocol with additional automated checks during the Asset QA stage, focusing on known problem areas. This improved early detection by 20%.

### 3. Streamlining Inter-Departmental Communication

**Challenge:**  
Communication breakdowns between departments caused delays in resolving issues and disrupted the workflow.

**Data Insights:**  
- Issues were often reported with insufficient detail, slowing down the resolution process.

**Solution:**  
Introduced a standardized issue reporting template and regular cross-departmental meetings to ensure clear and prompt communication, cutting down inter-departmental delays by 25%.

Data Interpretation: The graph shows an initial high count of issues, highlighting early production challenges in the Shading and Rigging departments. A gradual decline in issues reflects the positive impact of implemented solutions, such as specialized review stages and enhanced QA protocols. Occasional spikes indicate persistent challenges, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring and adjustment to maintain a consistent production process.

## Conclusion

The "CG TV Series Pipeline Optimization" project significantly enhanced production efficiency and quality by addressing key bottlenecks in the Shading and Rigging departments. This led to a 30% reduction in reworks and a 25% decrease in inter-departmental delays, showcasing the benefits of a proactive, data-driven approach.

By implementing enhanced QA protocols and standardized communication, we improved early issue detection by 20%. These measures not only streamlined current processes but also set the stage for long-term operational excellence, ensuring timely delivery and high-quality outputs.

The strategic impact of these improvements positions the team to handle future projects with greater efficiency and adaptability, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and readiness for industry challenges. This foundation will be crucial for maintaining competitiveness and innovation in a dynamic market.
